# First day of the rest of my life

So this Friday was my lasty day as a permanet employee. I quit to be back to contracting, ie to have my owne company and trying to carve something for myself.

## The plans 

My plan is to start contracting( still looking) and then to create my own IP to start being trully independent.

For now, I think I wlll try to post the status of my work every month.
